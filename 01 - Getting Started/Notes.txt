--> using minconda (lightweight-version of anaconda) as package manager
--> run "code ." command to open current directory in vscode

--> for creating a new project, always create a seperate environment to segregate the packages.
    --> navigate to the directory and run "conda create -p <env-name> python=<python-version>"         // creates a new environment
    
    --> run "conda activate ./<env-name>" to activate the environment                                  // only one environment can be active at a time
        --> run "conda deactivate" to deactivate the environment

    --> make a file requirements.txt to list all the external packages needed to be installed for the project
    --> run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the dependencies(packages) in the activated environment.

    Note : The packages required for all the projects globally is stored seperately by conda. 
           If two or more projects use same module of same version, conda avoids redundant installation of same module for different environments.
    
--> Two ways to run python code :-
    (1) Use jupyter notebook     (make .ipynb file)
        --> run "conda install ipykernel" or include it in requirements.txt              // install kernel for the jupyter code to run

    (2) Use simple python file   (make .py file)     and execute using python file_name.py

--> there is a intermediate between python and C called "cython"
    --> cython codes are first compiled using C compiler which can then be called anywhere in python file.
